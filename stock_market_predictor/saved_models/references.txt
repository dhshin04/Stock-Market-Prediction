    Validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters.

second_model.pth is the model that was trained using both the training and val sets.
    Test set was used to evaluate the performance of the model.

final_model.pth is the model trained using all three training, val, and test sets.
    It is the model used to predict on real-time data.
